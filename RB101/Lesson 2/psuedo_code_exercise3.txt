  # Casual

  Start defining the method as "every_other" with (a) as the inner variable
  make k = a.count
  make c = []
  make a variable called count1 = 0
  make a while count1 < (k - 1)
  in that while, p = a[count1]
  do c.push(p)
  then count1 = count1 + 2
  c
  # Formal

  START 

  DEF "every_other"(a)
  SET k = a.count
  SET c = []
  SET count1 = 0
  while count1 < (k-1)
    SET p = a[count1]
    c.push(p)
    SET count1 = count1 + 2
  c
